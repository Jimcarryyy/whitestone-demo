Whitestone WordPress Website Development with Custom Child Theme
This document outlines the development process for creating a WordPress website for Whitestone using a custom child theme based on the Underscores (_s) starter theme. The process focuses on setting up a robust local environment, implementing a responsive design based on Figma specifications, and ensuring clean, reusable code for an optimal user experience.
Development Process
1. Local Environment Setup

Installed XAMPP and MySQL to create a local development environment.
Created a dedicated MySQL database for the WordPress installation.
Downloaded the latest WordPress version, extracted it, and placed it in the htdocs directory of XAMPP.

2. Custom Child Theme Setup

Downloaded the Underscores (_s) starter theme as the foundation for the custom child theme.
Configured the child theme by adding a background image and activating it in the WordPress admin panel.

3. Asset Preparation

Exported images from the Whitestone Figma design file (specifically for the homepage).
Converted images to WebP format for optimized performance and faster page loading.

4. Global Styling

Modified style.css and style-rtl.css to define global styles.
Adjusted typography settings to align with Whitestoneâ€™s design specifications as outlined in the Figma file.

5. Enqueueing Assets

Updated functions.php to enqueue the following:
Custom CSS styles.
JavaScript files for interactivity.
FontAwesome for icon support.
Custom fonts to match the Whitestone design system.

6. Responsive Section Development

Developed the homepage section by section, ensuring each section was fully responsive down to the smallest viewport sizes.
Avoided bulk coding the entire homepage, prioritizing responsiveness and testing for each section individually.

7. Reusable Components

Created a components folder to house reusable UI components identified in the Figma design.
Structured components to be modular, enabling reuse across the homepage and other pages to maintain clean and maintainable code.
Demonstrated foresight by preparing for potential scalability, even though the test focused solely on the homepage.

8. Homepage Template Integration

Integrated reusable components into home-page.php to construct the homepage layout efficiently.

9. Dynamic Image Management

Configured all images to be dynamically sourced from the WordPress media library, ensuring flexibility for future content updates.

10. Enhanced User Experience

Implemented smooth fade-in and scroll animations to improve the visual appeal and user engagement.
Ensured animations were optimized for performance and compatibility across devices.

11. Migration Setup

Installed and configured the All-in-One WP Migration plugin to facilitate easy deployment and sharing of the website with the employer.

By leveraging a custom Underscores child theme, optimized assets, reusable components, and dynamic content management, the project ensures scalability, maintainability, and an enhanced user experience.
